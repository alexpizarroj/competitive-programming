LEVEL 1
======= 

Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and
finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space
station. From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the
LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the
lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or
you'll never make it to the top...

Commander Lambda sure is a task-master, isn't she? You're being worked to the
bone!

LEVEL 2
======= 

You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to
get yourself promoted. Hooray! Henchmen still don't have the kind of security
access you'll need to take down Commander Lambda, though, so you'd better keep
working. Chop chop!

You got the guards to teach you a game today. It's kind of pointless, but they
seem to like it and it helps you pass the time while you work your way up to
Commander Lambda's inner circle.

Rumor has it the prison guards are inexplicably fond of bananas. You're an apple
person yourself, but you file the information away for future reference. You
never know when you might need to bribe a guard or three...

LEVEL 3
======= 

Awesome! Commander Lambda was so impressed by your efforts that she's made you
her personal assistant. You'll be helping her directly with her work, which
means you'll have access to all of her files-including the ones on the LAMBCHOP
doomsday device. This is the chance you've been waiting for. Can you use your
new access to finally topple Commander Lambda's evil empire?

Commander Lambda has six suits, three dress uniforms, four casual outfits, and
one Dress-Uniform-For-Important-Speeches-Only. You know this because you've
already had to take all of them to the dry cleaner's. Twice!

As Commander Lambda's personal assistant, you get to deal with all of the
paperwork involved in running a space station big enough to house the LAMBCHOP.
And you thought Bunny HQ had too much bureaucracy...

For a world-destroying despot with a penchant for making space-station-sized
doomsday devices, Commander Lambda sure has good taste in office furniture.
As her personal assistant, you have the latest in standing desk and ergonomic
chair technology, and it sure makes a difference!

LEVEL 4
======= 

Excellent! You've destroyed Commander Lambda's doomsday device and saved Bunny
Planet! But there's one small problem: the LAMBCHOP was a wool-y important part
of her space station, and when you blew it up, you triggered a chain reaction
that's tearing the station apart. Can you rescue the imprisoned bunnies and
escape before the entire thing explodes?

This was supposed to be an infiltration-and-rescue mission, not a repeat of the
Great Cowland Station fiasco! You didn't think rescuing bunnies would involve
this much running. 

Six thousand, seven hundred and forty-one, six thousand, seven hundred and
forty-two, six thousand, seven hundred and forty-three... Good grief! Just how
many bunnies has Commander Lambda captured?!

LEVEL 5
======= 

Oh no! You escaped Commander Lambda's exploding space station - but so did she,
and she's definitely not happy with you. She's chasing you in her heavily-armed
starfighter, while you and your bunny refugees are stuck in these lumbering
escape pods. It'll take all your wits and cleverness to escape such a hare-y
situation, so you'd better hop to it!

It's not regulation, but you think if you can bypass the compressor, you can
squeeze a few extra bursts of speed out of this escape pod.

EPILOGUE
======== 

With one last roar of the escape pod's engines, you and your bunny companions
jump to lightspeed. Congratulations! You've destroyed the LAMBCHOP, rescued the
bunnies, gotten Commander Lambda off your tail, and saved the galaxy. Time for
a little rest and relaxation back on Bunny Planet.
Pat yourself on the back - you've earned it!
